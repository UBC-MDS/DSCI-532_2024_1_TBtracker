## üíª Contributing Code

Ready to dive in and contribute code? Here's how you can do that:

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine to work on the changes.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your work. This keeps your changes organized and separate from the main branch.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix.

5. **Write Tests**: If possible, write tests for your changes. This helps ensure that your contribution works as expected and helps prevent future regressions.

6. **Follow the Coding Style**: Please adhere to the coding style and guidelines of the project to keep the codebase consistent and readable.

7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once you're ready, submit a pull request to the main repository. Include a clear title and description of your changes. Link to any relevant issues your PR addresses.

8. **Code Review**: The project maintainers will review your PR. This process may involve some discussion and additional changes before your PR can be merged.
