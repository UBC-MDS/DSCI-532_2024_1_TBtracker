## About the Project

The Global Tuberculosis Tracker, developed by UBC MDS students, serves as a vital tool for visualizing Tuberculosis (TB) data worldwide. Aimed at NGOs, policymakers, and public health organizations, it simplifies the analysis of TB incidence, trends, and risk factors through intuitive visualizations. Utilizing WHO data, this application facilitates informed decisions in the fight against TB, highlighting the disease's dynamics and its interplay with risk factors like HIV. Our goal is to empower stakeholders with accurate data for strategic planning and interventions.
